  Hi, my name's Siddhartha and I'm a Software Engineer working at HSBC, Hyderabad. I am currently working in the Cards Engineering Division, and have worn both development and testing hats. 
  
  Having gained an ample amount of experience with CS from both my Bachelors degree and my work in industry, I am now looking for a switch from my current job, preferably within Hyderabad, Bangalore or Gurgaon (India). I can be contacted using the social buttons above. 

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>JavaScript</mark>, <mark>COBOL</mark>, and <mark>Selenium</mark>.
