    The backend of HSBC's credit card division primarily operates out of Hyderabad. I have worked in testing (July 2018 - June 2019), development (July 2019 - Sept 2020) and production support (Oct 2020 - Feb 2021) for the same.
    
    I have worked in a variety of regions for the division - including MENA, Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Mexico and India, and as a result, have gotten a feel for working on large codebases, and working on the entire development process - starting from the business requirements stage and ending at post-deployment support.
    
    I have also participated in internal hackathons conducted by HSBC at a pan-India level - and I have lead my team to the semi-finals for two years in a row.
