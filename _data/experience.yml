    The backend of HSBC's credit card division primarily operates out of Hyderabad. I have worked in both testing (July 2018 - June 2019) and development (July 2019 till present) teams for the same.
    
    I have worked in a variety of regions for the division - including MENA, Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam and India, and as a result, have gotten a feel for working on large codebases, and working on the entire development process - starting from the business requirements stage and ending at testing.
