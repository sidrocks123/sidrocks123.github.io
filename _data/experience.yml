   Working in the Credit Cards Engineering Division
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    The backend of HSBC's credit card division primarily operates out of Hyderabad. I have worked in both testing (July 2018 - June 2019) and development (July 2019 till present) for the same.
    
    I have worked in a variety of regions for the division - including MENA, Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam and India, and as a result, have gotten a feel for working on large codebases, and starting from the business requirements stage and ending at testing.
    
    I have also participated in internal hackathons conducted by HSBC at a pan-India level - I have lead my team to semi-finals for two years in a row.
