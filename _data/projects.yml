    The Math Word Problem Solver
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    I started this project because me and my teammates loved Math, which is not a popular subject because most students develop the placebo of hating Math without studying it in detail.
    
    The project can solve two categories of Arithmetic Word problems - Simple Interest, and questions involving two quantities and one operation.
    
    I was responsible for the Simple Interest category, building the working model, and hosting the finished product on a cloud provider.
    
    I gained a huge interest in Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, and Python as a result of successfully finishing the project.
    
    The project was also demonstrated to representatives of Trinity College, Dublin - and we received praise from them as well.
