    During my time at Thapar, I learnt most of my key skills that have helped me throughout my career such as teamwork and working under tight deadlines. I had the chance to work on many academic projects which taught me a variety of tools and technologies, such as C++, Python, LAMP stack, and APIs. 
    
    I thoroughly enjoyed my time at university, and learnt a lot about balancing the professional and personal facets of life.

    I spent a lot of my free time as a reporter, for the *Model United Nations*, and the unofficial institute newspaper, called *The Scribbler*.
